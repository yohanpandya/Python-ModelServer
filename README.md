Dockerfile, server.py, client.py and modelserver.proto create a client-server system for serving machine learning models via gRPC. Clients can connect to the server, set model coefficients, and make predictions using data from CSV files. The server caches predictions to improve performance, and the client reports the final prediction success rate after all threads have finished making predictions. This system can be used for real-time prediction services and machine learning model deployment.
